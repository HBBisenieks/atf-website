				I built this page because if I'm going to assign homework for the weekend I may as well eat my own dogfood. The purposes of this page are as follows:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To show that I can use ordered lists</li>
				<li>To demonstrate my grasp of CSS</li>
				<li>To link you to a page that has a bit more about me</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				So, <a href="about.html">would you perhaps like to know a bit more about me?</a>
